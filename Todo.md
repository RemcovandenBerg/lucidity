Roadmap:
  - async await stuff
  - scheduler (cron? hangfire? or background worker?)
  - 

For now:
 - Initial data filling with new EF-Core features
 - developing standardized CRUD components
    + Further separation of edit and details (routes + navigation)
    + transpose with `<ng-content></ng-content>`
 - implement Queries
 - implement Syncs
 - 

 
Considered:
  - migrations (nope)
