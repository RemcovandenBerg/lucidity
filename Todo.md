Roadmap: 
  - scheduler (cron? hangfire? or background worker?)
  - implement Syncs (UI / data)

Second:
  - async await stuff
  - unit testing
  - Initial data filling with new EF-Core features
  - developing standardized CRUD components
    + Further separation of edit and details (routes + navigation)
    + transpose with `<ng-content></ng-content>`

Later:
  - ui testing (protractor)

Considered:
  - migrations (nope)
