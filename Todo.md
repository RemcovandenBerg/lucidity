Roadmap:
  - async await stuff
  - scheduler (cron? hangfire? or background worker?)

For now:
 - Initial data filling with new EF-Core features
 - developing standardized CRUD components
   
    + transpose with `<ng-content></ng-content>`
    - implement Queries
    - implement Syncs
    - 

 
Considered:
  - migrations (nope)
